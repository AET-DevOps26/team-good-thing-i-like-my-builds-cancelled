✅ Monitoring Best Practices in Kubernetes

### 1. Separate Namespace

Deploy Prometheus and Grafana in a dedicated namespace (e.g.,
`monitoring`) to isolate observability tools from application
microservices.
This brings benefits like:

- Easier user permission management
- Resource limits (CPU/memory) via Kubernetes quotas
- Clear separation for upgrades, troubleshooting, and maintenance

---

### 2. Persistent Volumes

Ensure that Prometheus and Grafana retain important data across
restarts:

- Use Persistent Volumes (PVs) for Prometheus to keep historical metrics
- Use PVs for Grafana to persist dashboards and configuration

---

### 3. Label-Based Discovery

Label your services and pods consistently so Prometheus can discover
them automatically.
This ensures that metrics are still collected after updates or scaling.

**Recommended labels:**
```yaml
app: my-service
monitoring: "true"
```

**PrometheusSelector Example:**
```yaml
matchLabels:
  monitoring: "true"
```

### 4. Use ServiceMonitor / PodMonitor

Use special configuration files called ServiceMonitor and PodMonitor to
tell Prometheus which services or pods it should collect data from:

These objects are part of the Prometheus Operator and help define what
Prometheus should monitor. They automatically adapt to changes in your
deployments.

### 5. Dashboards as Code

Avoid manual configuration in environments:

- Store Grafana dashboards as version-controlled files (JSON)
- Use Helm or config maps to provision dashboards and data sources
- This ensures consistency and easier collaboration

### 6. Optional: Access Control

Secure your monitoring tools:

- Protect Prometheus and Grafana with authentication (e.g., via Rancher)
- Use TLS for encrypted connections
- Apply role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions

### 7. Version Visibility

Expose application version information as a custom Prometheus metric:

- Helps track which version is currently deployed
- Makes it easier to correlate performance changes or issues with
specific releases
- Visualize versions in Grafana dashboards

### 8. Alerting Rules

Set up meaningful and actionable alerts:
1. Define rules such as:

    - High error rate
    - Pod restart count > 5
    - Slow response time
2. Use PrometheusRule CRDs (Custom Resource Definitions) if working with
 Prometheus Operator
3. Connect to Alertmanager for routing alerts to:

    - Email
    - Slack
    - PagerDuty
